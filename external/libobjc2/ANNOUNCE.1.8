GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 1.8
===============================

This the ninth official release of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (a.k.a.
libobjc2).  This runtime was designed to support the features of modern
dialects of Objective-C for use with GNUstep and other Objective-C programs.
Highlights of this release include:

- Added API for tracing, allowing interposition on all message sends matching a
  given selector.

- Numerous bug fixes and stability improvements.

You may obtain the code for this release from git and use the 1.8 branch:

The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs, and a small number
of GCC APIs for legacy compatibility.

This library is based on the Étoilé Objective-C Runtime, an earlier research
prototype, and includes support for non-fragile instance variables,
type-dependent dispatch, and object planes.  It is fully backwards compatible
with the FSF's GCC 4.2.1 Objective-C ABI and also implements a new ABI that is
supported by Clang and Étoilé's LanguageKit and is required for some of the
newer features.
