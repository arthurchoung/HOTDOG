GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 1.x
===============================

This the ninth official release of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (a.k.a.
libobjc2).  This runtime was designed to support the features of modern
dialects of Objective-C for use with GNUstep and other Objective-C programs.
Highlights of this release include:

- Support for 64-bit ARM (AArch64) processors, including assembly fast paths
  for message sending.

- Improved the dispatch table representation to improve performance and cache
  usage on the fast path.

- The implementation of `imp_implementationWithBlock`, the function that allows
  blocks to be used as methods, no longer requires physical pages to be mapped
  both writeable and executable.

- Numerous improvements to the interaction between runtime functions and ARC.

- Support for Thumb-2 interworking on ARM.  Note that the library must be
  compiled for ARMv7 or ARMv6T2 for this code to be enabled.  Once it has been,
  other Objective-C binaries linked with the library can be compiled as ARM or
  Thumb-2 code.  This will also generate Thumb-2 message send functions,
  improving instruction cache usage.

You may obtain the code for this release from git and use the 1.x branch:

The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs, and a small number
of GCC APIs for legacy compatibility.

This library is based on the Étoilé Objective-C Runtime, an earlier research
prototype, and includes support for non-fragile instance variables,
type-dependent dispatch, and object planes.  It is fully backwards compatible
with the FSF's GCC 4.2.1 Objective-C ABI and also implements a new ABI that is
supported by Clang and Étoilé's LanguageKit and is required for some of the
newer features.
