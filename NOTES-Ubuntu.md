# HOTDOGbuntu

## Notes for Ubuntu and derivatives

(.deb file tested with xubuntu-22.04.1 / glibc 2.35)

Download the .deb file from http://hotdoglinux.com/download/

You'll also need the following packages installed:

```
sudo apt install libjson-perl
sudo apt install feh
sudo apt install compton
sudo apt install xterm
```

Install the .deb file:

```
dpkg -i HOTDOGbuntu_xxxxxxxx_amd64.deb
```

Log out, change the window manager from the login screen, then log back in.

Some things don't work properly when running on Ubuntu, for various reasons.

This is just to see if it runs. Slackware is preferred.

sudo apt install git
sudo apt install gobjc
sudo apt install libx11-dev

```

Edit build.pl at the top of the file to point to this library:

```

Then:

```
