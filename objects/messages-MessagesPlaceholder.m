@"VOICE-OVER:A way out west there was this fella, fella I want to tell you about, fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. Now, Dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then, there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. And a lot about where he lived, like- wise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place s'durned innarestin'.\n"
@"VOICE-OVER:They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and thisahere story I'm about to unfold-- wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me.\n"
@"VOICE-OVER:Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye rackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man-- I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee ro?--but sometimes there's a man ... and I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- sometimes there's a man, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there-- and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles... and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County.\n"
@"VOICE-OVER:...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide- but sometimes there's a man... sometimes there's a man.\n"
@"VOICE-OVER:Wal...\n"
@"VOICE-OVER:Lost my train of thought here. But...\n"
@"VOICE-OVER:Aw hell, I done innerduced him enough.\n"
@"GEORGE BUSH:--- call for a collective action. This will not stand. This will not stand! This aggression against, uh, Kuwait.\n"

@"LEBOWSKI:My wife, is not the issue here! I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she does not, that is her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman took them from me in Korea but I went out and achieved anyway. I cannot solve your problems, sir, only you can.\n"
@"DUDE:Ah fuck it.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Oh, \"Fuck it!\" Yes, that's your answer! That's your answer to everything! Tattoo it on your forehead!\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Your \"revolution\" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost!\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:My advice to you is, to do what your parents did! Get a job, sir! The bums will always lose-- do you hear me, Lebowski?\n"

@"DUDE:Ah, that must be exhausting.\n"
@"YOUNG WOMAN:You're not blowing.\n"
@"BRANDT:Our guest has to be getting along, Mrs. Lebowski.\n"

@"THE BOWLERS:Donny backs away from the line, turns and walks back.\n"
@"DONNY:Wahooo...I'm slammin' 'em tonight You guys are dead in the water!!\n"
@"WALTER:Alright! Way to go, Donny! If you will it, it is no dream.\n"
@"DUDE:You're fucking twenty minutes late, man. What the fuck is that?\n"
@"WALTER:Theodore Herzel.\n"
@"DUDE:Huh?\n"
@"WALTER:State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no dream.\n"
@"DUDE:What the fuck're you talking about man? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?\n"
@"WALTER:Huh? Oh!--Cynthia's dog. I think it's a Pomeranian. I can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture. I'm watching it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.\n"
@"DUDE:You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?\n"
@"WALTER:What do you mean \"brought it bowling\"? I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer. He's not taking your fucking turn, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself. Why can't she board it?\n"
@"WALTER:First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, this is a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can't board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out.\n"
@"DUDE:Hey man, Walter, you know--\n"
@"WALTER:Fucking dog has fucking papers- Over the line!\n"
@"SMOKEY:Huh?\n"
@"WALTER:I'm sorry Smokey, You were over the line, that's a foul.\n"
@"SMOKEY:Bullshit. Mark it eight Dude.\n"
@"WALTER:Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.\n"
@"SMOKEY:Bullshit. Walter! Mark it eight Dude.\n"
@"WALTER:Smokey, this is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.\n"
@"DUDE:Hey Walter come on, it's just--hey man it's Smokey. So his toe slipped over a little, you know, it's just a game, man.\n"
@"WALTER:This is a league game. This determines who enters the next round-robin, am I wrong?\n"
@"SMOKEY:Yeah, but I wasn't--\n"
@"WALTER:Am I wrong!?\n"
@"SMOKEY:Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight.\n"
@"WALTER:Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter--man--\n"
@"WALTER:You mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.\n"
@"SMOKEY:I'm not--\n"
@"WALTER:A world of pain.\n"
@"SMOKEY:Look Dude, I ... this is your partner--\n"
@"WALTER:HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY? AM I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES? MARK IT ZERO!\n"
@"DUDE:They're calling the cops, man, put the piece away.\n"
@"WALTER:MARK IT ZERO!\n"
@"DUDE:Walter put the piece away.\n"
@"SMOKEY:Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?\n"
@"WALTER:MARK IT ZERO!!\n"
@"SMOKEY:All right!! It's fucking zero! You happy, you crazy fuck?\n"
@"WALTER:It's a league game, Smokey!\n"
@"DUDE:You can't do that man. These guys, you know, they're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.\n"
@"WALTER:You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course--\n"
@"DUDE:And you know he's got emotional problems man!\n"
@"WALTER:You mean--beyond pacifism?\n"
@"DUDE:He's fragile, very fragile!\n"
@"WALTER:Huh. I did not know that. Well, it's all water under the bridge. And we do enter the next round robin, am I wrong?\n"
@"DUDE:No, you're not wrong--\n"
@"WALTER:Am I wrong!\n"
@"DUDE:You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.\n"
@"WALTER:Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They should be pushovers.\n"
@"DUDE:Man, willya just, just take it easy, man.\n"
@"WALTER:You know, that's your answer for everything, Dude. And let me point out something--pacifism is not- look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.\n"
@"DUDE:Just take it easy, man.\n"
@"WALTER:I'm perfectly calm, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah? Wavin' the fuckin' gun around?!\n"
@"WALTER:Calmer than you are.\n"
@"DUDE:Will you just take it easy?\n"
@"WALTER:Calmer than you are.\n"
@"VOICE:Dude, this is Smokey. Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gilbert and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round, I don't know, or maybe, forfeit it to us-- so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning. Tell Walter. I'm sorry.\n"
@"ANOTHER VOICE:Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, well--at Mr. Lebowski's office. Please call us as soon as is convenient.\n"
@"ANOTHER VOICE:Mr. Lebowski, this is Bell Salnicker with the Southern Cal Bowling League, and I just got a, an informal report, that a member of your team, uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a firearm during league play. If this is true of course, it contraviens a number of the league's by-laws, and article 27 of the league...\n"
@"MAN:Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Hey Marty.\n"
@"MARTY:Dude, I, I finally, I got the uh, venue I wanted. Uh, I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and well I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.\n"
@"DUDE:I'll be there man.\n"
@"MARTY:Uh, Dude, uh, tomorrow's already the tenth.\n"
@"DUDE:Far out. Oh, oh, alright, okay.\n"
@"MARTY:Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.\n"
@"VOICE:--serious infraction, and examine your standing. Thank you.\n"
@"VOICE:Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again. Please do call us as soon as you get in and I'll send the limo. I hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug, ha ha, which, I assure you, is not a problem. We need your help and, uh--well we would very much like to see you. Thank you. It's Brandt.\n"
@"BRANDT:We've had some terrible news. Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.\n"
@"BRANDT:Mr. Lebowski.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Funny-- I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?\n"
@"DUDE:Dude.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Huh?\n"
@"DUDE:Uh, I, I don't know, sir.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Is it being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the cost? Isn't that what makes a man?\n"
@"DUDE:Ummm..sure. That and a pair of testicles.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:You're joking. But perhaps you're right.\n"
@"DUDE:You mind if I do a jay?\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Bunny.\n"
@"DUDE:'Scuse me?\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Bunny Lebowski... She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir?\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, fuckin' A.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Strong men also cry... Strong men also cry.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:I received this fax this morning.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:As you can see, it is a ransom note.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Written by men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Cowards!\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Weaklings.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Bums.\n"
@"DUDE:Bummer.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Huh?\n"
@"DUDE:This is a bummer man. That's a, that's a bummer.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Brandt will fill you in on the details.\n"
@"BRANDT:Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.\n"
@"DUDE:Why me, man?\n"
@"BRANDT:He believes that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, disconfirm that suspicion.\n"
@"DUDE:He thinks the carpet-pissers did this?\n"
@"BRANDT:Well Dude, we just don't know.\n"
@"QUINTANA:Wheeling and thrusting a black gloved single finger into the air.\n"
@"DUDE:Fucking Quintana--that creep can roll, man--\n"
@"WALTER:Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah?\n"
@"WALTER:No. He's a sex offender. With a record. He did six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.\n"
@"DUDE:Huh.\n"
@"WALTER:When he moved down to Hollywood he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he was a pederast.\n"
@"DONNY:What's a pederast, Walter?\n"
@"WALTER:Shut the fuck up, Donny.\n"
@"WALTER:So. How much they give you?\n"
@"DUDE:Twenty grand, man. And of course I still keep the rug.\n"
@"WALTER:Just for making the hand-off?\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah.\n"
@"DUDE:...They gave uh, Dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call--\n"
@"WALTER:What if it's during a game?\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, I told him if it was during league play--\n"
@"DONNY:What's during league play?\n"
@"DUDE:Uh, ya know...\n"
@"WALTER:Life does not stop and start at your convenience --\n"
@"DUDE:I uh...\n"
@"WALTER:--you miserable piece of shit.\n"
@"DUDE:I, I figure uh,\n"
@"DONNY:What's wrong with Walter, Dude?\n"
@"DUDE:I figure it's easy money, ya know, it's all pretty harmless. She probably kidnapped herself.\n"
@"WALTER:Huh?\n"
@"DUDE:Aww...\n"
@"DONNY:What do you mean, Dude?\n"
@"DUDE:Rug-peers did not do this. Look at it. Young trophy wife. Marries this guy for money, she figures he isn't giving her enough. Ya know, She owes money all over town-- aww.\n"
@"WALTER:That...fucking...bitch!\n"
@"DUDE:It's all a goddamn fake man. It's like Leninsaid, you look for the person who will benefit. And uh,uh, you know, uh...\n"
@"DONNIE:I am the Walrus.\n"
@"DUDE:...you know... you'll, uh, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--\n"
@"DONNY:I am the Walrus.\n"

@"WALTER:Fucking exactly what happened. Those--\n"
@"DUDE:Hell yeah.\n"
@"WALTER:That makes me fucking SICK!\n"
@"DUDE:Well, what do you care, Walter?\n"
@"WALTER:Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--\n"
@"DUDE:Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:This fuckin' whore...\n"
@"DUDE:I don't see any--\n"
@"WALTER:...can waltz around town...\n"
@"DUDE:--connection with Vietnam, man.\n"
@"WALTER:Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. Your roll.\n"
@"WALTER:Have it your way, but my point is--\n"
@"DUDE:Your roll--\n"

@"QUINTANA:I see you rolled your way into the semis. Dios mio, man. Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah well, ya know, that's just, like uh, your opinion, man.\n"
@"QUINTANA:Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger till it goes \"click\".\n"
@"DUDE:Jesus.\n"
@"QUINTANA:You said it, man. Nobody fucks with the Jesus.\n"
@"WALTER:Eight-year-olds, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Aaaah...Oh man. Ohhhh...Awwww...\n"
@"BRANDT:They called about eighty minutes ago. They want you to take the money and drive north on the 405. They will call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only, they were very clear on that, or I'd go with you. One person only. What happened to your jaw?\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, nothin', man just ah--\n"
@"BRANDT:Here's the money...\n"
@"BRANDT:and the phone...\n"
@"BRANDT:Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.\n"
@"DUDE:Alright.\n"
@"BRANDT:Her life is in your hands.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, man, don't say that man.\n"
@"BRANDT:Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh shit, man.\n"
@"BRANDT:Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.\n"
@"DUDE:Where the fuck are you going, man?\n"
@"WALTER:Take the ringer. I'll drive.\n"
@"DUDE:The what?\n"
@"WALTER:The ringer! The ringer, Dude!\n"
@"DUDE:What the...\n"
@"WALTER:Have they called yet?\n"
@"DUDE:What the hell is this?\n"
@"WALTER:My dirty undies dude. Laundry, The whites.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies man.\n"
@"WALTER:Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter--what the fuck are you thinking man?\n"
@"WALTER:Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking. I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--\n"
@"DUDE:We? What the fuck we? You said you just wanted to come along--\n"
@"WALTER:My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong?\n"
@"DUDE:Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game man.\n"
@"WALTER:Oh, but it is a game. You said so yourself. She kidnapped herself.\n"
@"DUDE:I said I thought--\n"
@"DUDE:Dude here.\n"
@"VOICE:Who is this?\n"
@"DUDE:Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go?\n"
@"VOICE:Us?\n"
@"DUDE:Shit. . . yeah, you know, uh, me and the driver. I'm not uh, handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking--\n"
@"VOICE:Shut the fuck up.\n"

@"VOICE:Who is that?\n"
@"DUDE:That is the driver, I told you--\n"

@"WALTER:Easy, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:We're screwed now! We don't get shit, they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!\n"
@"WALTER:Nothing is fucked Dude. Come on. You're being very unDude. They'll call back. Look, she kidnapped her--\n"
@"WALTER:Ya see? Nothing's fucked here, Dude. Nothing is fucked. They're a bunch of fucking amateurs--\n"
@"DUDE:But Walter, Walter will you just shut the fuck up! Don't say peep when I'm doing business here man.\n"
@"WALTER:Okay Dude. Have it your way.\n"
@"WALTER:But they're amateurs.\n"
@"DUDE:Dude.\n"
@"VOICE:Okay, vee proceed. But only if there is no funny stuff.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah, yeah.\n"
@"VOICE:So no funny stuff. Okay?\n"
@"DUDE:Just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.\n"
@"DUDE:That was the sign man.\n"
@"WALTER:So, all we gotta do is get her back, no one's in a position to complain, and we keep the baksheesh.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah, terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we're gonna get her back. Where is she?\n"
@"WALTER:That's the simple part, Dude. We make the handoff, I grab one of 'em and beat it out of him.\n"
@"WALTER:...Huh?\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.\n"
@"WALTER:Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. Once a plan gets too complex, everything can go wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam--\n"

@"WALTER:Huh?\n"
@"DUDE:We throw the money out of the moving car!\n"
@"WALTER:No, we can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan.\n"
@"DUDE:Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'll fucking understand it! That's the beauty of it!\n"
@"WALTER:Wooden bridge, huh?\n"
@"DUDE:I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around man!\n"
@"WALTER:Ok, dude the bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Chop-chop!\n"
@"DUDE:Fuck that! Walter I love you, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.\n"
@"WALTER:Okay, Dude. No time to argue.\n"

@"WALTER:What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Com'on Dude. You said so yourself.\n"
@"DUDE:Man! I said I thought she kidnapped herself! You're the one who's so fucking certain--\n"
@"WALTER:That's right, Dude, 100% certain--\n"

@"DONNY:This Saturday. Quintana and--\n"
@"WALTER:Saturday! Well they'll have to reschedule.\n"

@"WALTER:They're gonna kill that poor woman.\n"
@"DONNY:Hey Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--\n"
@"WALTER:Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit. They're not gonna do shit. What can they do? They're a bunch of fuckin' amateurs. And meanwhile, look at the bottom line. Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?\n"
@"DUDE:Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars sittin' in the trunk of our car?\n"
@"DUDE:\"Our\" car, Walter?\n"
@"WALTER:And what do they got? My dirty undies. My fucking whites---Say, Dude, where is your car?\n"
@"DONNY:Who's got your undies, Walter?\n"
@"WALTER:Where's your car, Dude?\n"
@"DUDE:You don't know, Walter?\n"
@"WALTER:Hmm. It was parked in a handicapped zone. Perhaps they towed it.\n"
@"DUDE:You fucking know it's been stolen!\n"
@"WALTER:Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--\n"
@"DUDE:Aw, fuck it.\n"
@"DONNY:Where you going, Dude?\n"
@"DUDE:I'm goin' home, Donny.\n"
@"DONNY:Your phone's ringing, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Thank you, Donny.\n"
@"DUDE:Uh, yeah, uh, green. Some uh, brown, uh or, rust, coloration.\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:And was there anything of value in the car?\n"
@"DUDE:Oh uh, yeah. Uh, a tape deck. Some Creedence tapes. And there was a, uh. . .uh my briefcase.\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:In the briefcase?\n"
@"DUDE:Uh, uh Papers. Ya know, just papers. Uh you know, my papers. Business papers.\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:And what do you do, sir?\n"
@"DUDE:I'm unemployed.\n"
@"DUDE:My rug was also stolen.\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:Your rug was in the car.\n"
@"DUDE:No. Here.\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:Separate incidents?\n"
@"DUDE:You find them much? Uh these stolen cars?\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:Sometimes. I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.\n"
@"OLDER COP:Or the Creedence.\n"
@"DUDE:Well what about uhhhhhh, the briefcase?\n"
@"FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE:Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you. Call when you get home and I'll send a car for you. My name is Maude Lebowski. I'm the one who took your rug.\n"
@"YOUNGER COP:Well, I guess we can close the file on that one.\n"
@"VOICE:Elfranco. Ajuda me abajo. I'll be with you in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.\n"
@"MAUDE:Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?\n"
@"DUDE:Uh, is that what this is a picture of?\n"
@"MAUDE:In a sense, yes. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh yeah?\n"
@"MAUDE:Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his \"dick\" or his \"rod\" or his \"Johnson\".\n"
@"DUDE:\"Johnson\"?\n"
@"MAUDE:All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases. My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. Now.\n"
@"MAUDE:Your face... As for this \"kidnapping\"--\n"
@"DUDE:Huh?\n"
@"MAUDE:Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier. And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah, right, but, but let me explain something about that rug--\n"
@"MAUDE:Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?\n"
@"DUDE:Excuse me?\n"
@"MAUDE:Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it?\n"
@"DUDE:I was talking about my rug.\n"
@"MAUDE:You're not interested in sex?\n"
@"DUDE:You mean coitus?\n"
@"MAUDE:I like it too. It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. However there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, no.\n"
@"MAUDE:Oh yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.\n"
@"DUDE:Listen, Maude uh, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but uh, I don't see what this has to do with uh--do you have any Kahlua?\n"
@"MAUDE:Take a look at this, sir.\n"
@"DUDE:Hmm?\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, I know that guy. He's a nihilist.\n"
@"DUDE:Karl Hungus.\n"
@"BUNNY:Hi.\n"
@"ULI:Hello. Mein dizbatcher says zere iss somezing wrong mit deine kable.\n"
@"BUNNY:Yeah, come on in, I'm not really sure exactly what's really wrong with the cable.\n"
@"ULI:Dat's vhy day zent me, I'm un exspert.\n"
@"BUNNY:The TV's in here.\n"
@"MAUDE:You recognize her, of course.\n"
@"ULI:Helga, bring mein toolz.\n"
@"BUNNY:Oh, that's my friend Shari. She just came over to use the shower.\n"
@"MAUDE:The story is ludicrous.\n"
@"ULI:Mein nommen ist Karl. ich bin expert.\n"
@"SHARI:You must be here to fix the cable.\n"
@"MAUDE:Good lord. You can imagine where it goes from here.\n"
@"DUDE:He fixes the cable?\n"
@"MAUDE:Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.\n"
@"MAUDE:Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography, nor that she has been \"banging\" Jackie Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times. However. I am one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father. The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts and--\n"
@"DUDE:Shit yeah, the Achievers.\n"
@"MAUDE:Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this \"abduction\", but I tell you it is preposterous. This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah, but my-\n"
@"MAUDE:I'm getting to your rug. My father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. However, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.\n"
@"DUDE:Well-- I could do that--\n"
@"MAUDE:If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 10% of the recovered sum.\n"
@"DUDE:A hundred.\n"
@"MAUDE:Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah ah, but, but what about my uh--\n"
@"MAUDE:--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh that's that's fine. It doesn't even uh--\n"
@"MAUDE:Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man, and thorough.\n"
@"DUDE:Tha, tha, That's thoughtful but--\n"
@"MAUDE:Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man, and thorough.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh, uh... all right.\n"
@"DRIVER:--So he says, \"My wife's a pain in the ass. She's always tryin' to bust my friggin aggets, my daughter's married to a Jadrool loser bastard, I got a rash so bad on my ass I can't even siddown. But you know me. I can't complain.\"\n"
@"DUDE:Fuckin' A, man. I got a rash man. Fuckin' A...\n"
@"DUDE:...I gotta tell ya Ton' man, earlier in the day, I was feeling really shitty man. Really down in the dumps. Lost a little money...\n"
@"TONY:Heyh you know what? Forgeddaboutit huh, forgedaboutit.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah, fuck it man! I can't be worried about that shit. Life goes on man!\n"
@"TONY:Well home sweet home, Mr. L.\n"
@"TONY:Hey yo, com'eer. Who's your friend in the Volkswagon?\n"
@"DUDE:Huh?\n"
@"TONY:Yeah, he followed us here.\n"
@"DUDE:When did he start fol-- whoaaaa- what the fuck!\n"
@"SECOND CHAUFFEUR:Into the limo, you sonofabitch. No arguments.\n"
@"DUDE:Hey, hey, hey careful, man! There's a beverage here!\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Start talking and talk fast you lousy bum!\n"
@"BRANDT:We've been frantically trying to reach you, Dude.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!\n"
@"DUDE:Well, well we--I, I, I don't--\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:They did not receive the money, you nitwit! They did not receive the money! HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!\n"
@"BRANDT:This is our concern, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:No, man, nothing is fucked here--\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:NOTHING IS FUCKED!\n"
@"DUDE:No man--\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!\n"
@"DUDE:Well man, come on, who're you gonna believe? Those guys or uh--we dropped off the damn money--\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:WE?!\n"
@"DUDE:I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, man I've got certain information alright? Certain things have come to light, and uh, ya know, has it ever occurred to you, that uh, instead of uh, you know running around, uh uh, blaming me, given the nature of all this new shit, you know it, it it, this could be a uh, a lot more uh, uh, uh, uh, complex, I mean it's not just, it might not be, just such a simple, uh--you know?\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:What in God's holy name are you blathering about?\n"
@"DUDE:Well I'll tell you what I'm blathering about! I got information man--new shit has come to light and and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!\n"
@"DUDE:Well sure man, look at it! Ya know. A young trophy wife, in the parlance of our times, ya know. She uh, uh, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers- ha, and that's cool, that's that's cool-- I- I'm saying, she needs money man, and uh, you know, of course they're gonna say they didn't get it, uh uh, because she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I- I mean--uh, hasn't that ever occurred to you man? Sir?\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.\n"
@"BRANDT:That had not occurred to us, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Uh, okay, ya know, you guys aren't privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but hey, that's what you, that's what you pay me for. Aha... The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink. Um. Speaking of which, do you think uh, that you could uh, give me my twenty thousand in cash? Uh, my concern is, and I've gotta check with, with my accountant, but that this might bump me up into a higher tax uh--\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Brandt, give him the envelope.\n"
@"DUDE:Oh well, if you've already got the, check made out, that that's cool. Brandt is handing him a letter sized envelope which is distended by something inside.\n"
@"BRANDT:We received it this morning.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust. I have no choice but to tell these bums to do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski. And with Brandt as my witness, I will tell you this:\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:Any further harm visited upon Bunny, will be visited tenfold upon your head.\n"
@"LEBOWSKI:...My God sir. I will not abide another toe.\n"
@"WALTER (LAUGHING):That wasn't her toe dude.\n"
@"DUDE:Whose toe was it, Walter?\n"
@"WALTER:How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates--\n"
@"DUDE:The nail polish, Walter.\n"
@"WALTER:Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--\n"
@"DUDE:Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna get--\n"
@"WALTER:You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude.\n"
@"DUDE:But Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:You don't wanna know about it, believe me.\n"
@"DUDE:Yeah, but Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:Hell I can get you a toe by 3 o'clock this afternoon--with nail polish. These fucking amateurs.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit ourselves with fear. Jesus Christ.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter--\n"
@"WALTER:The point is--\n"
@"DUDE:They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--\n"
@"WALTER:Dude that's, that's just the stress talking, man. Now so far we have what appears to me, to be a series of victimless crimes--\n"
@"DUDE:What about the toe?\n"
@"WALTER:FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!\n"
@"WAITRESS:Excuse me sir, could you please keep your voices down, this is a family restaurant.\n"
@"WALTER:Oh, please dear! For your information: the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!\n"

@"DUDE:Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally? You might learn something. Now I got--\n"
@"MAUDE:And please don't call her my mother.\n"

@"DUDE:From the main guy, Uli.\n"
@"MAUDE:Uli Kunkel? Her \"co-star\" in the beaver picture?\n"

@"MAUDE:I might have introduced them for all I know.\n"
@"MAUDE:Do you remember Uli?\n"
@"MAN:umm.\n"

@"MAUDE:So he's pretending to be the abductor?\n"
@"DUDE:Well...yeah--\n"
@"MAUDE:Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone you're acquainted with. The whole idea is that the hostage can't be able to identify you, after you've let them go.\n"
@"DUDE:Well I, I I know that.\n"
@"DUDE:What the fuck is with this guy? Who is he?\n"
@"MAUDE:Knox Harrington, the video artist.\n"

@"DUDE:Which one's Logjammin'?\n"
@"TREEHORN:Yes regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude. Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest in little extras like story, production value, feelings.\n"
@"TREEHORN:People forget...\n"
@"TREEHORN:...that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--\n"
@"DUDE:On you, maybe.\n"

@"DUDE:Oh, Larry Sellers, this high-school kid. Real fucking brat.\n"
@"DUDE:Ya know, this is a very complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs. Uh, ya know. Fortunately I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug uh, regimen to keep my mind, you know, uh limber ya know. I'm very fucking close to your father's money.\n"

@"DUDE:No no, I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-up, why does he leave me in charge of getting his wife back? Because he doesn't fucking want her back, man! He's had enough! He no longer digs her! It's all a show! Okay? But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knows we never handed off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back. The million bucks was never in the briefcase. The briefcase was fucking empty, man! The asshole was hoping that they would kill her! You threw out a ringer for a ringer!\n"

@"WALTER:GODDAMNIT!! Is there a Ralph's around here?\n"
@"WALTER:Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was . . . He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer he explored the beaches of southern California...\n"
@"WALTER:...from La Jolla...\n"
@"WALTER:...to Leo Carillo and up to Pismo. He died--he died as so many young men of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom Lord you took him. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc...\n"
@"WALTER:...and Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And so'd Donny. Donny who loved bowling.\n"
@"WALTER:And so, Theodore--Donald- Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of...\n"

@"THE STRANGER:Heh heh.\n"
@"DUDE:Walter.\n"
@"THE STRANGER:The Dude abides...\n"
@"THE STRANGER:I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I sure hope he makes The finals. Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up. Things seem to've worked out pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt good story, dontcha think? Made me laugh to beat the band. Parts, anyway. I didn't like seein' Donny go. But then, I happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way. I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until we-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' again. Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed yourselves.\n"
@"THE STRANGER:Catch ya later on down the trail.\n"
@"THE STRANGER:...Say friend, ya got any more of that good sarsaparilla?...\n"
